    """
    Fishing practices are rapidly evolving, yet monitoring is lagging behind. Live onboard monitoring is often unfeasible for many vesselsâ€”due to lack of onboard conditions, restricted access, and remoteness of operations. However, all catches must come onshore to be monetized. Here lies the opportunity.
    \n\nWith **Post-Harvest Transparency**, we aim to accurately track every catch at the point of landing, providing unmatched precision in monitoring ocean resources, enforcing regulations, and offering transparency throughout the seafood supply chain.
    """

st.markdown(
    """
    **Problem**: Traditional catch identification relies on the eyes of experienced inspectors and manual weight scaling, which is prone to error and inefficiency.
    \n**Solution**: An AI-powered object detection model to identify species and estimate weight from images of the processed frozen catch at the point of landing.

    Our AI-driven object detection module has a single mission: bring transparency to post-harvest data in longline fisheries, a critical step in protecting ocean resources and ensuring responsible fishing practices.
    
    - Consumers know the fish alive in the ocean and the packaged products in supermarkets, but what about in-betweenâ€”processed catches being offloaded? These fish are head-off, tail-off, and gut-off, sometimes making identification almost impossible without expert human eyes.
    - We bring **efficiency and effectiveness** to this often-overlooked stage, with a **camera and smart detection** system that records everything automaticallyâ€”species, weight, quantity.

    2. **Identifying Distinguishing Characteristics**: Define specific features of processed fish to help train the AI model. Use expert insights to understand how each species can be identified even after processing.
    
    3. **Model Development**: Use **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for feature extraction. Develop a regression model to estimate weight using multi-angle images.
    
    4. **Validation and Implementation**: Test the model on-site to ensure reliability. Calibrate with periodic scale measurements to enhance accuracy.

While AI is theoretically capable of achieving this, we are currently focused on data collection, after which we will move to model development and validation to ensure reliability.")
